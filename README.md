# Excel Column Mapper & Merger (Streamlit)

Merge multiple Excel files into a single CSV with standardized column names — even when headers differ slightly. Includes fuzzy header matching, an editable mapping table, a `source_file` column, detailed logs, and local folder pickers.

## Features
- Select **input folder** (recursively optional) and **output folder**
- Auto-suggest mappings using fuzzy matching (configurable threshold)
- Edit mappings in a table; group many headers → one standardized name
- Merge to CSV with a `source_file` column
- Logs and validation per file + error reporting
- 100% local processing


---

## Run on macOS
1. Install **Python 3.10+** (`python3 --version`).
2. In Terminal:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/excel-merger
   chmod +x run_mac.command
